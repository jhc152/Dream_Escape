# Dream_Escape

The instructions,


Prepare for bed by making sure you have a calm and comfortable environment in which to focus.

Close your eyes and visualize the dream you want to enter. Imagine the setting, the details, and the challenges you might face.

Once you are inside the dream, note that you have 3 life hearts. Avoid getting hit by enemies to avoid losing hearts. If you lose all 3 hearts, you will die and have to start over.

Look for the boxes scattered around the dream. Pick up the boxes and take them to the central switch. You have 10 seconds for each square required to activate the switch.

Deposit the required number of boxes at the central switch within the time limit. By doing so, the enemies will disappear and the key to the next dream will be revealed.

Locate the key and touch it to go to the next dream. When you enter the next dream, your hearts of life will be restored.

Repeat steps 3 through 6 for each of the 10 different dreams. Remember to avoid getting hit by the enemies and make sure to collect the boxes and activate the switches before the time runs out.

If you die or wake up (fall) from sleep at any point, you'll have to start over. Stay focused and agile to avoid situations that could jeopardize your progress.

Use strategies to efficiently overcome obstacles and enemies. If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, look for alternate routes.

Keep time in mind and manage it wisely as you collect the boxes and activate the switches. Remember that you only have 10 seconds for each required box.

Follow these instructions and stay calm and focused on each dream. Good luck on your challenge to complete all 10 different dreams without dying!
